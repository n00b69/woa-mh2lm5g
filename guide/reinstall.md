# Running Windows on the LG V50

## Reinstalling Windows

### Prerequisites
- [Windows on ARM image](https://worproject.com/esd)
  
- [Drivers](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-flashlmdd/releases/tag/Drivers)

- [Mass storage image](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-flashlmdd/releases/download/Files/msc.img)

### Reboot to fastboot mode
> If you don't have access to fastboot, use the instructions in the [partitioning guide](1-partition.md) to flash the engineering ABL.
- With the device turned off, hold the **volume down** button, then plug the cable in.
- If the phone in device manager is called **Android** and has a ⚠️ yellow warning triangle, you need to install fastboot drivers before you can continue.

#### Boot to the mass storage mode UEFI
> Replace **<path\to\msc.img>** with the actual path of the image
```cmd
fastboot boot <path\to\msc.img>
```

#### Enabling mass storage mode
> Once booted into the UEFI, use the volume buttons to navigate the menu and the power button to confirm
- Select **UEFI Boot Menu**.
- Select **USB Attached SCSI (UAS) Storage**.
- Press the **power** button twice to confirm.

### Diskpart
```cmd
diskpart
```

#### Finding your phone
> This will list all connected disks
>
> Look for your phone (which should be the last disk which will be 117GB in size). If you do not see it, wait a few seconds and run the command again. Repeat this until you see the disk.
```cmd
lis dis
```

#### Selecting your phone
> Replace $ with the actual number of your phone
```cmd
sel dis $
```

#### Listing your phone's partitions
> This will list your device's partitions
```cmd
lis par
```

#### Selecting the Windows partition
> Replace $ with the partition number of Windows (should be 32)
```cmd
sel par $
```

#### Add letter to Windows
```cmd
assign letter x
```

#### Exit diskpart
```cmd
exit
```

#### Formatting Windows
> Go to Windows Explorer > This PC and select **WINFLASH**. Right click and format as NTFS.

### Installing Windows
> Replace `<path\to\install.esd>` with the actual path of install.esd (it may also be named install.wim)

```cmd
dism /apply-image /ImageFile:<path\to\install.esd> /index:6 /ApplyDir:X:\
```

> If you get `Error 87`, check the index of your image with `dism /get-imageinfo /ImageFile:<path\to\install.esd>`, then replace `index:6` with the actual index number of Windows 11 Pro in your image

### Installing Drivers
> Unpack the driver archive, then open the `OfflineUpdater.cmd` file

> Enter the drive letter of **WINFLASH**, which should be X, then press enter

### Boot into Windows
Reboot your phone. If you end up in Android instead of Windows, flash the UEFI again using WOA Helper.

#### Setting up Windows
> Your device will now set up Windows. This will take some time. It will eventually reboot, and after that the initial setup (oobe) should launch.

> [!Note]
> To skip the Microsoft Account login, use "g" for the email and password. Windows will then let you make a local account

## Finished!
