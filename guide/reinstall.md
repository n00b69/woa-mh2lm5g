# Running Windows on the LG V50S

## Reinstalling Windows

### Prerequisites
- [ADB & Fastboot](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

- [Modded TWRP](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-mh2lm5g/releases/download/Files/modded-twrp-g8x.img)

### Reboot into fastboot mode
> If you don't have access to fastboot, use the instructions in the [partitioning guide](1-partition.md) to flash the engineering ABL.
- With the device turned off, hold the **volume down** button, then plug the cable in.

### Opening CMD as an admin
> Download **platform-tools** and extract the folder somewhere, then open CMD as an **administrator**.
>
> It is recommended to keep this window open and use it throughout the entire guide.
> 
> Replace `path\to\platform-tools` with the actual path to the platform-tools folder, for example **C:\platform-tools**.
```cmd
cd path\to\platform-tools
```

#### Boot into the modded TWRP
> Replace `path\to\modded-twrp-g8x.img` with the actual path of the provided TWRP image
>
> After booting into TWRP, leave the device on the main screen. You can press the power button to turn the display off, if you want
```cmd
fastboot boot path\to\modded-twrp-g8x.img
```

### Formatting Windows and ESP partitions
```cmd
adb shell format
```
