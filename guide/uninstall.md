# Running Windows on the LG V50S

## Uninstalling Windows 
> There are two methods to uninstall Windows; manually, or by restoring the stock rom. If you are using a custom rom and want to keep this rom, method 2 is recommended.

## Method 1: Restoring the stock ROM

### Prerequisites
- [ADB & Fastboot](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

- [Stock ROM (.kdz)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10G72--uM5viwszJt8eY0q5PUjC53yzS2jvncdiJPaEk)

- [Patched LG Up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkUfZ26-zajXLc-NDQFrOWCbwKDQvIZ/view?usp=sharing)

### Entering Download Mode
- While your device is turned off, hold the **volume up** button, then plug in a USB cable that is connected to your PC.

> [!Note]
> If Download Mode does not start, you may need to restore the original **abl** file with QFil, which you should have backed up when partitioning your device (located at `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\Qualcomm\QFIL\COMPORT_#\`

### Flashing your stock ROM
- Open **LG Up** while your device is booted into **Download Mode**.
- Select the stock ROM .kdz & select the `Refurbish` option in **LG Up**, then start flashing.
- Wait for the process to finish and your device should automatically reboot.

## Finished!
