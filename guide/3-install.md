# Running Windows on the LG V50S

## Installing Windows

### Prerequisites
- [Modded TWRP](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-mh2lm5g/releases/download/Files/modded-twrp-g8x.img)

- [Windows on ARM image](https://arkt-7.github.io/woawin/)
  
- [Drivers](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-mh2lm5g/releases/tag/Drivers)

- [UEFI image](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-mh2lm5g/releases/tag/UEFI)

### Reboot into fastboot mode
- With the device turned off, hold the **volume down** button, then plug the cable in.

### Boot modified TWRP recovery
> Replace `path\to\modded-twrp-g8x.img` with the actual path of the image
```cmd
fastboot boot path\to\modded-twrp-g8x.img
```

#### Execute the msc script
```cmd
adb shell msc
```

> [!Note]
> If you are facing issues (e.g your device does not enter mass storage mode), follow [the steps described in this guide](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-mh2lm5g/blob/main/guide/troubleshooting.md#mass-storage-mode-does-not-work) for alternative ways of entering mass storage mode.

### Diskpart
> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT ERASE, CREATE OR OTHERWISE MODIFY ANY PARTITION WHILE IN DISKPART!!!! THIS CAN ERASE ALL OF YOUR UFS OR PREVENT YOU FROM BOOTING TO FASTBOOT!!!! THIS MEANS THAT YOUR DEVICE WILL BE PERMANENTLY BRICKED WITH NO SOLUTION! (except for flashing it with EDL, which is complicated)
```cmd
diskpart
```

#### Select the Windows volume of the phone
> Use `list volume` to find it, replace `$` with the actual number of **WINMH2LM5G**
```diskpart
select volume $
```

#### Assign the letter X
> If letter `X` cannot be assigned, use letter `A` instead, and replace the letter `X` in future commands with the letter `A`
```diskpart
assign letter x
```

#### Select the ESP volume of the phone
> Use `list volume` to find it, replace `$` with the actual number of **ESPMH2LM5G**
```diskpart
select volume $
```

#### Assign the letter Y
> If letter `Y` cannot be assigned, use letter `B` instead, and replace the letter `Y` in future commands with the letter `B`
```diskpart
assign letter y
```

#### Exit diskpart
```cmd
exit
```

### Installing Windows
> [!Important]
> For performance reasons, it is recommended to use Windows 11 24H2 (builds that start with 261XX, such as 26100.2454)
>
> Do not install, or update to, Windows 11 25H2 26200.7XXX or higher! You will not be able to boot into this build due to a BSoD issue!

> Replace `path\to\install.esd` with the actual path of install.esd (it may also be named install.wim or 22631.2861.XXXXXXX.esd)

```cmd
dism /apply-image /ImageFile:path\to\install.esd /index:6 /ApplyDir:X:\
```

> If you get `Error 87`, check the index of your image with `dism /get-imageinfo /ImageFile:path\to\install.esd`, then replace `index:6` with the actual index number of **Windows 11 Pro** in your image

### Copying your boot.img into Windows
- Drag and drop the **rooted_boot.img** from the **platform-tools** folder into the **WINMH2LM5G** disk in Windows Explorer, then rename it to **boot.img**

### Installing drivers
- Unpack the driver archive, then open the `OfflineUpdater.cmd` file (if an error shows up, run `OfflineUpdaterFix.cmd` instead)

> If it asks you to enter a letter, enter the drive letter of **WINMH2LM5G** (which should be **X**), then press enter
  
#### Create the Windows bootloader files
> If any error shows up, such as "Failure when attempting to copy boot files", open `diskpart` again and assign any new letter to **ESPMH2LM5G**, then replace the letter `Y` in the next commands with the letter that you just added.
>
> Reboot your PC if no letters are available to be assigned.
```cmd
bcdboot X:\Windows /s Y: /f UEFI
```

#### Enabling test signing
```cmd
bcdedit /store Y:\EFI\Microsoft\BOOT\BCD /set "{default}" testsigning on
```

#### Disabling recovery
```cmd
bcdedit /store Y:\EFI\Microsoft\BOOT\BCD /set "{default}" recoveryenabled no
```

#### Disabling integrity checks
```cmd
bcdedit /store Y:\EFI\Microsoft\BOOT\BCD /set "{default}" nointegritychecks on
```

#### Remove the drive letter for ESP
> If this does not work, ignore it and skip to the next command. This phantom drive will disappear the next time you reboot your PC.
```cmd
mountvol y: /d
```

### Rebooting into fastboot mode
```cmd
adb reboot bootloader
```

### Boot into the UEFI
> Replace `path\to\mh2lm5g-uefi.img` with the actual path of the image
```cmd
fastboot boot path\to\mh2lm5g-uefi.img
```

### Reboot into Android
Your device should reboot by itself after +- 10 minutes of waiting, after which you will be booted into Android, for the last step.
