> DO NOT REBOOT YOUR PHONE if you think you made a mistake, ask for help in the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/woahelperchat).

### Preparing necessary files
- Download **Mh2lm5gDriverUpdater.zip** and keep it in your **internal storage** (if you are using LineageOS 20), else, put it in your **SD card**.

### Flash the modified TWRP
> Or boot into TWRP if you've already installed it.
- In **Magisk**, select the **modded-twrp-g8x-installer.zip** and flash it.
- Return to the main menu, press the rotating arrow icon in the top right, and press `Reboot Recovery`.

### Flashing DriverUpdater
- In TWRP, select **Install** and then locate **Mh2lm5gDriverUpdater.zip** and flash it.
- Once you're given the option to reboot, do so.
> [!Note]
> Wait untill all processes complete and your device boots back into Windows. This will take around 20-30 minutes.

## Finished!
